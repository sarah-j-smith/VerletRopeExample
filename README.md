# VerletRopeExample

Example of using the VerletRope classes


# Notes

The very first time this is run, the rope is very unstable.  Once it stabilises, you then save the data.

Quit the app and restart.

All other runs use the saved data.

In a production game you can ship the game with the saved data file inside the bundle.
